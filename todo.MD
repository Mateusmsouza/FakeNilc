# TO DO

## General
Parse arguments from command line on `reduce.py`
Update verbosity system to use logs instead of prints 

## Feature Extraction
Extract some of coh-metrics features using another tool (coh-metrix isn't available outside a lab virtual machine)

## Classification
train and save trained models instead of just evaluating their performance with 5-fold cv

## Perfomance
Improve perfomance on feature extraction and text reduction using parallel computing
Improve mlp training speed using GPU

## Documentation
Update readme.MD with correct instructions for CLI arguments of `extract.py` and `classify.py`
