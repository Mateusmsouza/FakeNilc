# TO DO

## General
Parse arguments from command line on `extract.py` and `reduce.py`

## Classification
Create a `classify.py` script that will automatically train classifiers and assert their accuracy.
Use Scikit-learn or Weka on the scripts

## Perfomance
Improve perfomance on feature extraction using parallel computing
Use CUDA on classifier training (maybe switch from Weka to TensorFlow?)
