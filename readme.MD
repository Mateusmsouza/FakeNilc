# FakeNilc
A "Fake News" classifier developed in Python3.

## Usage

There are three steps involved in running this program.
1. preprocessing
2. feature extraction
3. classifier training

### Preprocessing
To use it, you must run `reduce.py`. This will balance the corpus texts lenght by comparing the number of words of two given texts (one real, one fake).

**Parameters:**

edit these in the `reduce.py` file.

`news_dir`: path to the folder containing texts to be reduced

`output_dir`: path were the reduced texts should be saved


Please note that this step isn't required for the feature extraction, but it's recommended. 

### feature extraction
To use it, you must run `extract.py`. This will extract a set of features from the texts and save them in a .csv file. Then, it can join the .csv files generated for classification.


**Parameters:**

Edit these in the `extract.py` file.

`output_dir`: where generated result will be saved.

`output_csv`: where generated intermediary .csv files will be saved.

`news_dir`: folder containing texts to be used for extraction.

`parameters`: list with parameters to be extracted. Each parameter is a string with the name of the feature to be extracted. They are: `LIWC`,`POS`,`Coh-Metrix`,`Freq-Full` (for a bag of words representation of all words in the texts), or `Freq-X` where X is the number of the top X words, according to frequency in the texts.

`join`: boolean. If `True`, will generate a tagged .csv file joining all features described in `parameters`. If `False`, does not join or tag any .csv file.

### Classifier Training
Currently, this program does not train classifiers automatically. To do so, use your own scikit-learn script or run Weka.

## Setup

### Requirements

**Python Packages**

1. NLTK (make run to run NLTK.download() and download its data)
2. Numpy
3. Scikit-Learn (for Freq features)
4. nlpnet (for POS features)
..nlpnet requires h5py and scipy.. 
5. Pandas (for joining csv's)

2. Extract it to a folder
3. Edit the parameters in the `.py` files with the correct parameters
